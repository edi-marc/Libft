# Libft

Project for [42 Roma Luiss](https://42roma.it/) 

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that youâ€™ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

## Getting Started

The project inside the folder [Libft_v1](Libft_v1) refers to an initial and much older version, tested only on the Mac OS operating system.

In the folder named [Libft](Libft), we find a recent version of the project developed and tested on a Linux environment.

See the subjects for further information

The repository contains a main, usefull to test the functions.

### Build the library

The following command builds the library, without the bonus functions
```

```


The following command builds the complete library, also with the bonus functions
```

```


For testing the library with the main, use this command:

```
